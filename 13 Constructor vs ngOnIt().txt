1) Define component 'App'
	1.1) App component implements OnInit() interface

export class App implements OnInit{
  constructor(){						//constructor of component  //called when 								//component created

     //called first time before the ngOnInit()	//initialize properties and dependencies
  }

  ngOnInit(){						//lifecycle hook method
					//additional initialization tasks on component
		//called after the constructor and called  after the first ngOnChanges()
  }
}


Conclusion:
	constructor: called before ngOnIt()

	
	ngOnIt() : called after constructor , after ngOnChanges

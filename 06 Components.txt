1) Angular App = tree of components
2) part of / similar to directives
	
3) must have template
	 one component per element can only be instantiated


import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component ({
   selector: 'my-app',
   template: ` <div>
      <h1>{{title}}</h1>
      <div>Learn Angular6 with examples</div>
   </div> `,
})

export class AppComponent {
   title: string = 'Welcome to Angular world';
}


4) Components vs Directives

Components:
How to register? @Component annotation
What use? Create UI widgets
 break application into components
1 Component per DOM element
@View decorator is mandatory
template is mandatory


Directive:
How to register? @Directive annotation
What use? add function to existing DOM element
 Design reusable components
Many directives per DOM element
Does not use View

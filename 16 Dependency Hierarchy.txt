If component or service requests a dependency:
	1) look in local injector
	2) look in parent injector
	3) ....
	.. root injector


AppModule		//root injector
   |
   |- AppComponent		//AppComponent has its own local injector
         |
         |- ChildComponent		//has its own local injector




2) Understand how angular resolves dependencies
	//Ensure components and services have right dependencies injected at right time
